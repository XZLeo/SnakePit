# üêç Customize Your Snake

You can influence your snake‚Äôs behavior, learning process, and appearance by modifying a few key files. Below is a guide to what you can change and what it means.

---

## üéØ 1. Reward Function (`Gym/rewards.py`)

The reward system defines how your snake evaluates its actions. The default reward structure is:

```python
self.reward_dict = {
    "another_turn": 0,   
    "ate_food": 0,  
    "won": 0,                 
    "died": 0,
    "ate_another_snake": 0, 
    "hit_wall": 0,           
    "hit_other_snake": 0,    
    "hit_self": 0,     
    "was_eaten": 0, 
    "other_snake_hit_body": 0,
    "forbidden_move": 0,     
    "starved": 0              
}
```

### Reward Tuning Guidelines

1. **Survival Rewards**
   - `another_turn`: Small positive reward encourages survival
   - `died`, `starved`: Negative rewards discourage early death

2. **Food Strategy**
   - `ate_food`: Moderate reward encourages food gathering
   - Balance with survival rewards to prevent reckless food pursuit

3. **Combat Behavior**
   - `ate_another_snake`: High reward promotes aggressive play
   - `was_eaten`: Penalty encourages caution
   - `hit_other_snake`: Adjust to control aggression level

4. **Movement Penalties**
   - `hit_wall`: Large penalty prevents wall collisions
   - `hit_self`: Discourages self-intersection
   - `forbidden_move`: Prevents illegal moves

### Example Modifications

For an aggressive snake you might want to reward eating other snakes etc. Come up with the combination that you think will win the game!


Modify these values to shape your snake's behavior, then test different combinations in training to find the optimal strategy for your goals.

## üß† 2. Opponent Snake Behavior (`snakes/random_snake.py`)

Opponent behavior influences the environment your snake learns in. The default opponent chooses random actions:

```python
def choose_action(observation, info):
    return random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])  # UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
```

Create new snakes in the snakes directory with the same structure as random_snake.py. Modify the choose_action function to your wishes.
```bash
python train.py --opponents hungry_snake
```

You can also train against one of your models by running:

```bash
python train.py --opponents path/to/your/model
```

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Training Hyperparameters in your training script

These affect how your snake learns during training:

```python
# ---- Config ----

TOTAL_TIMESTEPS = 1000_000
SAVE_INTERVAL = 1000
N_STEPS_COLLECT = 2000 
PPO_BATCH_SIZE = 64
N_EPOCHS_PPO = 4
LR = 3e-4
GAMMA = 0.99
GAE_LAMBDA = 0.95
PPO_CLIP = 0.2

YOUR_SNAKE_INDEX = 0
OBS_TYPE = "flat-51s"
MAP_SIZE = (11, 11)          # Size of the board

```


## üéØ 4. Heuristic Function (`heuristic.py`)

The heuristic function validates moves and provides action masking. You can customize this function to add sophisticated decision-making logic that works alongside your trained model.

### Default Implementation

```python
# filepath: /Users/isakknutsson/Desktop/AIS/SnakePit/heuristic.py
def heuristic(matrix):
    """
    Validates moves using the game state matrix.
    
    Args:
        matrix: Game state with shape (height, width, 3)
               channel 0: food (1)
               channel 1: your snake (head=5, body=1)
               channel 2: other snakes (head=5, body=1)
    
    Returns:
        valid_moves: List of safe directions
        moves: Dictionary of direction validity
        action_mask: Boolean tensor for [up, down, left, right]
    """
```

### Customization Possibilities

1. **Safety Enhancements**
- Snake collision prediction
- Trap detection
- Space analysis using flood fill
- Path blocking detection

2. **Strategic Elements**
- Food path weighting
- Territory control
- Opponent head tracking
- Safe retreat routes

3. **Model Integration**
- Override model on low confidence
- Risk-based decision weights
- Hybrid decision making
- Emergency fallback logic

4. **Advanced Features**
- Area control scoring
- Distance-based risk assessment
- Food path optimization
- Head-to-head conflict resolution

### How to Modify

1. Create a new function that wraps the base heuristic:
```python
def advanced_heuristic(matrix, critic_value=None):
    valid_moves, moves, action_mask = heuristic(matrix)
    
    # Add your custom logic here
    # Example: Override on low confidence
    if critic_value is not None and critic_value < 0.3:
        # Implement safety-first logic
        pass
        
    return valid_moves, moves, action_mask
```

2. Replace the standard heuristic in `train.py` and `launch.py`:

```python
# In train.py and launch.py, update the heuristic import
from heuristic import advanced_heuristic as heuristic
```

Remember:
- Keep modifications efficient
- Test thoroughly with different scenarios
- Balance safety vs opportunity
- Consider performance impact
