# ðŸš€ Exposing a Local Server with ngrok 
To be able to use your Snake on the [BattleSnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) website you must setup a server that hosts the functions responsible for your snake. An easy way of doing so is by setting up a ngrok server that listens to a localhost port.
Follow these steps to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose a local server to the internet.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- Python, Node.js, or any other server running locally (e.g., `localhost:5000`)
- ngrok installed (instructions below)

- ## ðŸ“¦ Step 1: Install ngrok

### Option 1: Download from Website

Go to [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download), download the binary, and unzip it.

### Option 2: Install via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

### Option 3: Install via Chocolatey (Windows)

```bash
choco install ngrok
```

### Option 4: Install via Apt (Linux)
```bash
curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
  && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
  && sudo apt update \
  && sudo apt install ngrok
```

## ðŸ“¦ Step 2: Create ngrok account and follow instructions for installation
Go to [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup), and setup your account.


## ðŸ“¦ Step 3: Configure and deploy ngrok
Copy the authtoken found on the dashboard after creating an account in the previous step. Configure your ngrok with the following command.
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <token>
```

## ðŸ“¦ Step 4: Click the static domain and claim free static domain

## ðŸ“¦ Step 5: Paste the command in to your terminal. The last digits are which ports the ngrok server listens to. We have it to default at 8080 so, change it 8080




![static_domain](images/localhost.png)

This will be the output:

![server](images/server.png)

Copy the url in the Forwarding. This is the domain name

## Do not close the terminal window running this command. It has to be active for the server to be running




## ðŸ“¦ Step 4: Create BattleSnake account
Head over to [https://play.battlesnake.com/](https://play.battlesnake.com/) and create your account

## ðŸ“¦ Step 4: Create a Snake and link to server url

Under My battlsnake, click on create BattleSnake. 

![battle](images/myBattle.png)


Fill in with prefered name etc. Under Server URL, make sure to print the previously made ngrok domain name.
